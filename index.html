Nearly crystal clear, ultra pale straw yellow appearance. This looked like your typical macro larger. The body was topped by an inch-tall, tight and creamy, bright white head that quickly dropped to a medium sized collar. No lacing whatsoever.

A crisp, dry, powdery yeasty quality dominated the aroma initially. As the head receded, pale, pilsner malt notes appeared. Somewhat grainy with a touch of sulfur. There was a hint of lemony brightness too.

The flavor profile was cleaner and more interesting than the nose. Crackery malts led things off on the front end. Touch of raw grain and wheatiness. Bright lemon notes came through strong as the beer moved along the palate. Bit of sulfur on the back end. The beer finished with more lemony tartness and just a touch of earthy hop bitterness.

Excellent fluffy, lighter bodied mouthfeel. Pillowy soft and smooth on the palate. The liquid contained a super fine, fairly zippy effervescence that was spot-on for a beer of this style.

BANDO E85-R is an unleaded racing fuel containing 85 volume % ethanol. It can only be used in fuel systems designed specifically for E85 blends. Because it is highly oxygenated and requires increased fuel flow compared to conventional non-oxygenated fuels, consult with your fuel injection system or carburetor supplier for correct air/fuel ratio calibrations. BANDO E85-R does not contain metallic additives and will not harm oxygen sensors. It should be stored in dark, tightly sealed containers where the temperature is stable. Handled under such conditions, shelf life is in excess of 1 year. Check with your fuel system and fuel container manufacturers for compatibility with ethanol and E85 blends. Please note that due to the high oxygenation of E85-R, the octane values are estimated.
